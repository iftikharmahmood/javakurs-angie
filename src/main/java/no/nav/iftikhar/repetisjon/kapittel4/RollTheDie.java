/*
 * The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
 * Roll the die for the user (generate a Random number between 1 â€“ 6) and advance the user that number of spaces on the game board.
 *
 *After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win.
 *
 * Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.
 *
 * However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - they've won.
 *
 * If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
 *
 * Remember there are only 20 spaces on the board, so a message like "You advanced to space 22" is a bug.
